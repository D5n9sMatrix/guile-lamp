        *    The function close closes the file descriptor files. Closing a file       *
        *    has the following consequences:                                             *

        *    The file descriptor is deallocated.  Any record locks owned by the          * 
        *    process on the file are unlocked.  When all file descriptors                * 
        *    associated with a pipe or FIFO have been closed, any unread data is         *
        *    discarded.  This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded         *  
        *    programs. This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources          *
        *    (like memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time         *
        *    close is called. If the thread gets canceled these resources stay           * 
        *    allocated until the program ends. To avoid this, calls to close should      * 
        *    be protected using cancellation handlers.                                   *

        *    case of failure. The following error error conditions are defined for       *
